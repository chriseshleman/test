```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

So if I try to mess around with dplyr or the tidyverse and save it via R Markdown, I'm hoping the process will be similar to what I found before. 

```{r cars}
head(cars, 3) 
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
